Dogglers - Kotlin Study
==================================

Reference: [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

Introduction
------------

Added the missing code on the starter code for the Dogglers app project in the [final pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-unit-2-pathway-3) of Android Basics [Unit 2](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-2). This project was an opportunity for me to demonstrate the concepts that I learned in the unit.
